<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
<p><i>For other uses, see Laptop (disambiguation).</i></p>
<p><i>A <b>laptop computer </b>or<b> notebook computer,</b> also known as a <b>laptop</b>or <b>notebook</b> for short, is a small, portable <a href="#">personal computer</a> (PC). Laptops typically have a <a href="#">clamshell form factor</a> with a <a href="#">flat panel screen</a> (usually 11–17 in or 280–430 mm in diagonal size) on the inside of the upper lid and an <a href="#">alphanumeric keyboard</a> and <a href="#"> pointing device</a> (such as a <a href="#">trackpad</a> and/or /<a href="#">trackpoint</a>) on the inside of the lower lid, although <a href="#">2-in-1 PCs</a> with a detachable <a href="#">keyboard</a> are often marketed as laptops or as having a "laptop mode".<a href="#">[1][2]</a> Most of the computer's internal hardware is fitted inside the lower lid enclosure under the keyboard, although many laptops have a built-in <a href="#">webcam </a>at the top of the screen and some modern ones even feature a<a href="#"> touch-screen </a>display. In most cases, unlike <a href="#">tablet computers </a>which run on <a href="#">mobile operating systems,</a> laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems which have been traditionally associated with <a href="#">desktop computers.</a></i></p>
<p><i>

Laptops run on both an <a href="#">AC power supply </a>and a <a href="#">rechargeable battery pack</a> and can be folded shut for convenient storage and transportation, making them suitable for <a href="#">mobile use.[3]</a> Today, laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at work (especially on <a href="#">business trips</a>), in <a href="#">education</a>, for <a href="#">playing games</a>, <a href="#">web browsing</a>, for personal <a href="#">multimedia,</a> and for general <a href="#">home computer</a> use.
</i></p>
<p><i>


The names "laptop" and "notebook" refer to the fact that the computer can be practically placed on (or on top of) the user's lap and can be used similarly to a<a href="#"> notebook</a>. As of 2022, in <a href="#">American English</a>, the terms "laptop" and "notebook" are used interchangeably;<a href="#">[4]</a> in other <a href="#">dialects of English,</a> one or the other may be preferred. Although the term "notebook" originally referred to a specific size of laptop (originally smaller and lighter than mainstream laptops of the time),<a href="#">[5]</a> the term has come to mean the same thing and no longer refers to any specific size.</i></p>
<p>
<i>
Laptops combine many of the input/output components and capabilities of a <a href="#">desktop computer</a> into a single unit, including a display screen, small speakers, a keyboard, and a pointing device (such as a touch pad or pointing stick). Most modern laptops include a built-in webcam and microphone, and many also have a touchscreen. Laptops can be powered by an internal <a href="#">battery</a> or an external <a href="#">power supply</a> by using an <a href="#">AC adapter</a>. Hardware specifications may vary significantly between different types, models, and <a href="#">price points.</a></i></p>
<p><i>

Design elements, form factors, and construction can also vary significantly between models depending on the intended use. Examples of specialized models of laptops include <a href="#">rugged notebooks</a> for use in construction or <a href="#">military applications,</a> as well as <a href="#">low-production-cost</a> laptops such as those from the <a href="#">One Laptop per Child </a>(OLPC) organization, which incorporate features like <a href="#">solar charging</a> and semi-flexible components not found on most laptop computers. Portable computers, which later developed into modern laptops, were originally considered to be a small<a href="#"> niche market,</a> mostly for specialized field applications, such as in the military, for accountants, or traveling sales representatives. As portable computers evolved into modern laptops, they became widely used for a variety of purposes.<a href="#">[6]</a></i></p>
