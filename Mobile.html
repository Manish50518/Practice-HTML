A <b>mobile phone</b> (or <b>cellphone</b> <a href="#">[a]</a>) is a portable  <a href="#">telephone</a> that can make and receive  <a href="#">calls</a> over a  <a href="#">radio frequency </a>link while the user is moving within a telephone service area, as opposed to a fixed-location phone  <a href="#">(landline phone).</a> The radio frequenvcy link establishes a connection to the switching systems of a  <a href="#">mobile phone operator, </a>which provides access to the  <a href="#">public switched telephone network</a> (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone services use a  <a href="#">cellular network</a> architecture and therefore mobile telephones are called cellphones (or "cell phones") in North America. In addition to  <a href="#">telephony, digital mobile phones</a> support a variety of other  <a href="#">services,</a> such as  <a href="#">text messaging, multimedia messagIng, email, Internet access </a>(via  <a href="#">LTE, 5G NR or Wi-Fi</a>), short-range wireless communications ( <a href="#">infrared, Bluetooth</a>), satellite access ( <a href="#">navigation, messaging connectivity</a>), business applications,  <a href="#">video games </a>and  <a href="#">digital photography.</a> Mobile phones offering only basic capabilities are known as <a href="#"> feature phones;</a> mobile phones which offer greatly advanced computing capabilities are referred to as  <a href="#">smartphones.[1]</a></i></p>

The first handheld mobile phone was demonstrated by <a href="#"> Martin Cooper</a> of  <a href="#">Motorola </a>in <a href="#"> New York City</a> on 3 April 1973, using a handset weighing c. 2 kilograms (4.4 lbs).[2] In 1979,  <a href="#">Nippon Telegraph and Telephone </a>(NTT) launched the world's first cellular network in Japan. <a href="#">[3]</a> In 1983, the  <a href="#">DynaTAC 8000x </a>was the first commercially available handheld mobile phone. From 1983 to 2014, worldwide mobile phone subscriptions grew to over seven billion; enough to provide one for every person on Earth. <a href="#">[4]</a> In the first quarter of 2016, the top  <a href="#">smartphone</a> developers worldwide were  <a href="#">Samsung, Apple</a> and  <a href="#">Huawei;</a> smartphone sales represented 78 percent of total mobile phone sales. <a href="#">[5]</a> For <a href="#"> feature phones </a>( <a href="#">slang</a>: "dumbphones") as of 2016, the top-selling brands were Samsung,  <a href="#">Nokia </a>and  <a href="#">Alcatel.[6]</a></i></p>

Mobile phones are considered an important human invention as it has been one of the most widely used and sold pieces of consumer technology. <a href="#">[7]</a> The growth in popularity has been rapid in some places, for example in the UK the total number of mobile phones overtook the number of houses in 1999. <a href="#">[8]</a> Today mobile phones are globally ubiquitous, <a href="#">[9]</a> and in almost half the world's countries, over 90% of the population own at least one. <a href="#">[10]</a></i></p>

<h1>History</h1>

A handheld mobile radio telephone service was envisioned in the early stages of radio engineering. In 1917, <a href="#">Finnish</a> inventor<a href="#"> Eric Tigerstedt</a> filed a patent for a "pocket-size folding telephone with a very thin carbon microphone". Early predecessors of cellular phones included<a href="#"> analog </a>radio communications from ships and trains. The race to create truly portable telephone devices began after World War II, with developments taking place in many countries. The advances in <a href="#">mobile telephony </a>have been traced in successive "generations", starting with the early zeroth-generation <a href="#">(0G)</a> services, such as<a href="#"> Bell System's Mobile Telephone Service</a> and its successor, the Improved Mobile Telephone Service. These 0G systems were not <a href="#">cellular,</a> supported few simultaneous calls, and were very expensive.

 The first handheld cellular mobile phone was demonstrated by <a href="#">John F. Mitchell[11][12] </a>and <a href="#">Martin Cooper of Motorola</a> in 1973, using a handset weighing 2 kilograms (4.4 lb).<a href="#">[2]</a> The first commercial automated cellular network (<a href="#">1G</a>) <a href="#">analog</a> was launched in Japan by<a href="#"> Nippon Telegraph and Telephone </a>in 1979. This was followed in 1981 by the simultaneous launch of the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) system in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden.</a>[13] Several other countries then followed in the early to mid-1980s. These first-generation<a href="#"> (1G)</a> systems could support far more simultaneous calls but still used<a href="#"> analog</a> cellular technology. In 1983, the <a href="#">DynaTAC 8000x</a> was the first commercially available handheld mobile phone.</i></p>

In 1991, the second-generation <a href="#">(2G)</a> digital cellular technology was launched in Finland by <a href="#">Radiolinja</a> on the <a href="#">GSM </a>standard. This sparked competition in the sector as the new operators challenged the incumbent 1G network operators. The GSM standard is a European initiative expressed at the <a href="#">CEPT</a> ("Conférence Européenne des Postes et Telecommunications", European Postal and Telecommunications conference). The Franco-German R&D cooperation demonstrated the technical feasibility, and in 1987 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between 13 European countries who agreed to launch a commercial service by 1991. The first version of the GSM (=2G) standard had 6,000 pages. The <a href="#">IEEE</a> and<a href="#"> RSE </a>awarded to <a href="#">Thomas Haug</a> and<a href="#"> Philippe Dupuis</a> the 2018 <a href="#">James Clerk Maxwell medal</a> for their contributions to the first digital mobile telephone standard.[14] In 2018, the GSM was used by over 5 billion peovple in over 220 countries. The GSM (2G) has evolved into 3G, 4G and 5G. The standardisation body for GSM started at the CEPT Working Group GSM (Group Special Mobile) in 1982 under the umbrella of CEPT. In 1988, <a href="#">ETSI</a> was established and all CEPT standardization activities were transferred to ETSI. Working Group GSM became Technical Committee GSM. In 1991, it became Technical Committee SMG (Special Mobile Group) when ETSI tasked the committee with UMTS (3G).</i></p>
<p><i>
In 2001, the third generation (<a href="#">3G</a>) was launched in Japan by <a href="#">NTT DoCoMo</a> on the <a href="#">WCDMA</a> standard.<a href="#">[15]</a> This was followed by 3.5G, 3G+ or turbo 3G enhancements based on the <a href="#">high-speed packet access</a> (HSPA) family, allowing <a href="#">UMTS networks</a> to have higher data transfer speeds and capacity.
</i></p>
<p><i>

By 2009, it had become clear that, at some point, 3G networks would be overwhelmed by the growth of bandwidth-intensive applications, such as <a href="#">streaming media.[16]</a> Consequently, the industry began looking to data-optimized fourth-generation technologies, with the promise of speed improvements up to ten-fold over existing 3G technologies. The first two commercially available technologies billed as <a href="#">4G</a> were the <a href="#">WiMAX</a> standard, offered in North America by Sprint, and the <a href="#">LTE</a> standard, first offered in Scandinavia by <a href="#">TeliaSonera.</a></i></p>
<p><i>

<a href="#">5G</a> is a technology and term used in research papers and projects to denote the next major phase in mobile telecommunication standards beyond the <a href="#">4G/IMT-Advanced </a>standards. The term 5G is not officially used in any specification or official document yet made public by telecommunication companies or standardization bodies such as <a href="#">3GPP, WiMAX </a>Forum or <a href="#">ITU-R.</a> New standards beyond 4G are currently being developed by standardization bodies, but they are at this time seen as under the 4G umbrella, not for a new mobile 
generation.</i></p>
