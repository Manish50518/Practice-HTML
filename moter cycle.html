A <b>motorcycle (motorbike, bike,</b> or, if three-wheeled, a <b>trike)</b> is a two or three-wheeled <a href="#">motor vehicle steered </a>by a <a href="#">handlebar </a>from a saddle-style seat.<a href="#">[1][2][3]</a>
</p></i>
<p><i>
Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: <a href="#">long-distance</a> travel,<a href="#"> commuting, cruising,</a> sport (including <a href="#">racing),</a> and <a href="#">off-road </a>riding.<a href="#"> Motorcycling </a>is riding a motorcycle and being involved in other related social activities such as joining a <a href="#">motorcycle club</a> and attending <a href="#">motorcycle rallies.</a>
</p></i>
<p><i>
The 1885  <a href="#">Daimler Reitwagen</a> made  <a href="#">by Gottlieb Daimler</a> and  <a href="#">Wilhelm Maybach</a> in Germany was the first internal combustion, <a href="#"> petroleum</a>-fueled motorcycle. In 1894,  <a href="#">Hildebrand & Wolfmüller</a> became the first series production motorcycle. <a href="#">[4][5]</a></p></i>
<p><i>

Globally, motorcycles are comparably popular to cars as a method of transport. In 2021, approximately 58.6 million new motorcycles were sold around the world, <a href="#">[6]</a> fewer than the 66.7 million cars sold over the same period. <a href="#">[7]</a></p></i>
<p><i>


In 2022, the top four motorcycle producers by volume and type were  <a href="#">Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki,</a> and <a href="#"> Suzuki.[8]</a> In developing countries, motorcycles are considered utilitarian due to lower prices and greater  <a href="#">fuel economy.</a> Of all the motorcycles in the world, 58% are in the Asia-Pacific and Southern and Eastern Asia regions, excluding car-centric Japan. <a href="#">[citation needed]</a></p></i>
<p><i>
According to the  <a href="#">US Department of Transportation,</a> the number of fatalities per  <a href="#">vehicle </a>mile traveled was 37 times higher for motorcycles than for cars. <a href="#">[9]</a>

<p><i>
The term motorcycle has different legal definitions depending on jurisdiction (see <a href="#">§ Legal definitions and restrictions</a>).</i></p>
<p><i>


There are three major types of motorcycle: street, off-road, and dual purpose. Within these types, there are many sub-types of motorcycles for different purposes. There is often a <a href="#">racing</a> counterpart to each type, such as <a href="#">road racing</a> and street bikes, or <a href="#">motocross</a> including dirt bikes.</i></p>
<p><i>


Street bikes include <a href="#">cruisers, sportbikes, scooters</a> and <a href="#">mopeds,</a> and many other types. Off-road motorcycles include many types designed for dirt-oriented racing classes such as <a href="#">motocross</a> and are not street legal in most areas. Dual purpose machines like the <a href="#">dual-sport</a> style are made to go off-road but include features to make them legal and comfortable on the street as well.</i></p>
<p><i>

Each configuration offers either specialised advantage or broad capability, and each design creates a different riding posture.</i></p>
<p><i>

In some countries the use of <a href="#">pillions</a> (rear seats) is restricted.</i></p>
<h1>History</h1> 
<hr/>
<p><i>Main article:<a href="#"> History of the motorcycle</a></i></p>
<p><i><b>Experimentation and invention</b></i></p>
<p><i>The first <a href="#">internal combustion, petroleum</a> fueled motorcycle was the<a href="#"> Daimler Reitwagen.</a> It was designed and built by the German inventors <a href="#">Gottlieb Daimler</a> and<a href="#"> Wilhelm Maybach</a> in <a href="#">Bad Cannstatt,</a> Germany, in 1885.<a href="#">[10] </a>This vehicle was unlike either the <a href="#">safety bicycles </a>or the <a href="#">boneshaker</a> bicycles of the era in that it had zero degrees of <a href="#">steering axis angle </a>and no <a href="#">fork offset,</a> and thus did not use the principles of <a href="#">bicycle and motorcycle dynamics</a> developed nearly 70 years earlier. Instead, it relied on two outrigger wheels to remain upright while turning.<a href="#">[11]</a></i></p>
<p><i>
The inventors called their invention the Reitwagen ("riding car"). It was designed as an expedient testbed for their new engine, rather than a true prototype vehicle.<a href="#">[12][13]</a>
</i></p>
<p><i>The first commercial design for a self-propelled cycle was a three-wheel design called the Butler Petrol Cycle, conceived of<a href="#"> Edward Butler </a>in <a href="#">England </a>in 1884.<a href="#">[14] </a>He exhibited his plans for the vehicle at the <a href="#">Stanley Cycle Show </a>in London in 1884. The vehicle was built by the <a href="#">Merryweather Fire Engine</a> company in <a href="#">Greenwich,</a> in 1888.<a href="#">[15]</a></i></p>
<p><i>


The Butler Petrol Cycle was a three-wheeled vehicle, with the rear wheel directly driven by a 5⁄8 hp (0.47 kW), 40 cc (2.4 cu in) displacement, 2+1⁄4 in × 5 in (57 mm × 127 mm) bore × stroke, <a href="#">flat twin four-stroke engine</a> (with <a href="#">magneto ignition </a>replaced by coil and battery) equipped with <a href="#">rotary valves</a> and a float-fed <a href="#">carburettor</a>(five years before<a href="#"> Maybach</a>) and <a href="#">Ackermann steering,</a> all of which were state of the art at the time. Starting was by compressed air. The engine was liquid-cooled, with a<a href="#"> radiator </a>over the rear driving wheel. Speed was controlled by means of a <a href="#">throttle </a>valve lever. No braking system was fitted; the vehicle was stopped by raising and lowering the rear driving wheel using a foot-operated lever; the weight of the machine was then borne by two small castor wheels. The driver was seated between the front wheels. It was not, however, a success, as Butler failed to find sufficient financial backing.<a href="#">[16]</a></i></p>
<p><i>


Many authorities have excluded <a href="#">steam powered, electric motorcycles </a>or diesel-powered two-wheelers from the definition of a 'motorcycle', and credit the Daimler Reitwagen as the world's first motorcycle.<a href="#">[17][18][19]</a> Given the rapid rise in use of electric motorcycles worldwide,<a href="#">[20]</a> defining only internal-combustion powered two-wheelers as 'motorcycles' is increasingly problematic. The first (petroleum fueled) internal-combustion motorcycles, like the German Reitwagen, were, however, also the first practical motorcycles.<a href="#">[18][21][22]</a></i></p>
<p><i>

If a two-wheeled vehicle with steam propulsion is considered a motorcycle, then the first motorcycles built seem to be the French<a href="#"> Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede</a> which patent application was filed in December 1868,<a href="#">[12][13]</a> constructed around the same time as the American <a href="#">Roper steam velocipede,</a> built by<a href="#"> Sylvester H. Roper</a> of <a href="#">Roxbury, Massachusetts,[12][13]</a> who had been demonstrating his machine at fairs and circuses in the eastern U.S. since 1867.<a href="#">[10] </a>Roper built about 10 steam cars and cycles from the 1860s until his death in 1896.<a href="#">[19]</a></i></p>
